I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at {{< staticref "https://www.emory.edu/home/index.html" "newtab" >}}Emory University{{< /staticref >}}, USA. I also hold a BA in Economics from {{< staticref "https://en.uoa.gr/" "newtab" >}}National and Kapodistrian University of Athens{{< /staticref >}} (UOA), Greece. 

My 10-years of experience in real-world economic problems, has equipped me with a strong skillset in **Data Analysis** (data processing, cleansing & modeling) and in **Programming** which are valuable assets to profitable companies. 

My work and academic experience have equipped me with both the *qualitative* and the *quantitative* tools to address a variety of economic problems including **Business Data-Driven Decision Making**. I have worked with datasets in areas such as investments, banking, real estate, and healthcare.
