I am an Applied Scientist in the forecasting team at {{< staticref "https://www.zillowgroup.com/" "newtab" >}}Zillow{{< /staticref >}}. I enjoy travelling, sports and fine dining.

My Ph.D. is in Economics from {{< staticref "https://www.emory.edu/home/index.html" "newtab" >}}Emory University{{< /staticref >}}, USA, and my BA is in also in Economics from {{< staticref "https://en.uoa.gr/" "newtab" >}}National and Kapodistrian University of Athens{{< /staticref >}} (UOA), Greece. Since being in high school, economics was the field I wanted to acquire deep expertise in. Dealing with concrete, typically unprecedented economic problems is still my passion.

My 11-years of experience in real-world economic problems, has equipped me with a strong skillset in **Exploratory Economic Data Analysis** (microeconomic analysis, identification of leading indicator model features, model selection and validation, causal inference), **Scientific Programming** (data manipulation, modeling, estimation, forecasting, visualization) and Applied Econometric Time Series **Model Development & Forecasting** (data engineering skills, cloud computing, building economically interpretable business models, producing US market wide forecasts).

My work and academic experience have equipped me with both the *qualitative* and the *quantitative* tools to address a variety of economic problems including **Business Data-Driven Decision Making**. I have worked on product related projects which have direct or indirect implications to business strategy and revenue.  Example datasets I have worked on are in areas such as investments, banking, financial risk, real estate, statistics and healthcare.
