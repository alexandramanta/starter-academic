---
Statcounter has a lot of useful {{< staticref "https://statcounter.com/features/" "newtab" >}}features{{< /staticref >}}. To get website analytics for your netlify website, follow the steps below:
- Sign up to {{< staticref "https://statcounter.com/" "newtab" >}}Statcounter{{< /staticref >}}.
- Create a project which will be about your website.
- Statcounter will create a tracking code for you, so it asks for the link of your website.
- Provide this link and paste **your** tracking code in your repo: I put **mine** in my Github {{< staticref "https://github.com/alexandramanta/starter-academic/blob/master/layouts/partials/custom_head.html" "newtab" >}}alexandramanta/starter-academic/layouts/partials/custom_head.html{{< /staticref >}}. 
- ! Copy and pasting my tracking code to your repo **is not going to work**, you need to have your own tracking code.

Good luck!
